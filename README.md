# Color Picker

This simple app demonstrates the use of input fields to select a color according to RGB parameters and an alpha channel representing the transparency. One of the things to pay attention to is which event listener to use. When using the "change" event, the setting of the input appears only after the change. When using an "input" event, there is a nice effect of running numbers. I also added a nice feature that identifies whether the background is light or dark and changes the color of the text accordingly.

- Cahnge event [Change Event]
